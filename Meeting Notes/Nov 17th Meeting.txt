Topics: M3 Midpoint Submission

Expected state of code:
- Core features
- RESTful endpoints
- documentation through fastAPI
not all code on the backend has to be done but the basics should be there
    - we are here for functionallity we need to focus on the other points for M3

What we still need to do:
- Testing:
    - Minimum unit and integration Testing
    - Evidence of test execution (screenshots/reports)
    - "Each student must have at least 10 pull requests showcasing this variety of testing methods."

- Quality Assurance:
    - Github actions -> need to setup pipeline

- Refactoring:
    - 5 pull requests per member

- Deployment(Basic):
    - Need to demonstrate running the backend in a environment for the demo

Other Notes:
    - Our pull requests to date seem to be larger than expected from the evaluation. Try splitting them into smaller chunks going forward if applicable

Task Delegation:
Everyone:
    - Write some tests
    - Do some Refactoring

Deployment: Eshan
    - Needed for demo on Monday(not due with report)
